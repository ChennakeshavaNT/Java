PROBLEM STATEMENT:
		
		PROBLEM NO. 2 OF THE QUESTIONS PDF
		(BINARY SEARCH PROBLEM)

DESCRIPTION :

		1.THE PROGRAM WORKS ON DIVIDE AND CONQUER APPROACH
		2.VALUE OF N AND X ARE TAKEN AS COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
		3.THE ARRAY IS DIVIDED INTO 2 PARTS AT INDEX VALUE M
		4.ARRAY ELEMENTS ARE RANDOMLY GENERATED USING RANDOM FUNCTION
		5.VALUE OF M IS RANDOMLY GENERATED 
		6.VALUE OF M IS CALCULATED BY A FUNCTION findm() 
		7.AFTER CALCULATING VALUE OF M , ARRAY ELEMENTS ARE SORTED 
		8.BINARY SEARCH IS APPLIED ON THE SORTED ARRAY
		9.BINARY SEARCH FUNCTION FINDS THE PRESENCE OF X IN THE ARRAY AND OUTPUTS ITS STATUS
		10.THE ELEMENTS GENERATED ARE PLACED IN ELEMENT.TXT
		11.THE SORTED ELEMENTS ARE PLACED IN SORTED.TXT

CHALLENGES FACED:

		1.UNDERSTANDING THE GENERATION OF RANDOM VALUES TO GENERATE INPUT FOR THE PROGRAM
		2.CONVERTING THE IDEA TO THE SOLUTION
		3.SINCE THE INPUT WOULD BE IN MILLIONS WE MODIFIED AND IMPROVED THE CALCULATION 
		4.DECREASING THE COMPUTATION REQUIRED
		5.SORTING A PART OF ARRAY(FROM INDEX 0 TO M) RATHER THAN AS A WHOLE
		6.UNDERSTANDING THE FILE OPERATIONS AND USE AS PER THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
		7.UNDERSTANDING THE BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM AND MODIFY IT AS PER THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
		8.CONVERTING THE ITERATIVE BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM TO A RUCURSIVE ALGORIHTM
		9.HANDLING THE EXCEPTIONS GENERATED

PROBLEM OUTCOMES:

		1.WE GOT KNOWLEDGE ON FILE OPERATION AND ARE ABLE TO USE THEM IF REQUIRED
		2.WE GOT MORE HANDS ON EXPERINCE ON SOLVING PROBLEM RATHER THAN ANALYZING GIVEN PROBLEM SOLUTIONS
		3.WE GOT MORE KNOWLEDGE ON RECURSION TECHNIQUE AND ARE AWARE OF BASIC REQUIEMENTS AND FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED TO APPLY RECURSION
		4.WE ARE ABLE TO SOLVE BASIC PROBLEM STATEMENTS 

PROCEDURE TO EXECUTE PROGRAM:

		1.COMPLIE THE PROGRAM 
		2.RUN THE PROGRAM ON ANY IDE 
		3.INPUT THE VALUES OF N AND X
			THE PROGRAM TAKES COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS WITH 2 PARAMETERS 
			1.N - SIZE OF ARRAY
			2.X - ELEMENT TO BE FOUND

EXAMPLE TO EXECUTE :

		1.JAVAC BINARY.JAVA
		2.JAVA BINARY 100000 5897 ( HERE N-10000 AND X-5897)
		3.//OUTPUT OF PROGRAM WILL APPEAR HERE

SAMPLE OUTPUT :

		OUTPUT FOR N-58985685 AND X-58645


		ENTERED SIZE OF ARRAY IS 58985
		THE RANGE IN WHICH 'M' VALUE TO BE GENERATED : 242 <= M <= 58985685
		RANDOMLY GENERATED VALUE OF  M:14572 
		Randomly Generated Value of M: 14572
		BASIC OPERATION : COMPARISION OPERATION
		CALCULATED VALUE OF M:14572
		TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPARISIONS :14
		ARRAY ELEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE IN SORTED.TXT
		................ELEMENT 58645 NOT FOUND.................	

CONCLUSION :
	
		THE PROBLEM AS BEEN SOLVED AS PER THE GIVEN CRITERIAS AND OUTPUT GENERATED IS TRUE FOR HIGHER LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE
